      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I really want to expand my knowedge base. I think I could really learn to enjoy this type of work giving it the proper level of commitment and practice. I think the only reason I didn't like coding before was never developing a true understanding of how it worked.</p>
